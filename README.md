How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User stories help with this in a number of ways. Most notably to me is that it allows for multiple people to make 
  changes over the course of the ticket. Let's say its a testing ticket. One person could write the test steps, another 
  could run them, and another could automate them in the end. Over the course of three weeks using the same ticket. 
  It helps keep track of all that information and completed work.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  In my admittedly, limited experience, it means going above and beyond. As I've stated multiple times I am but a lowly tester. 
  But when I automate stuff, I make it as modular and portable as possible. Rewriting property checks to use dictionaries, using 
  those dictionaries across multiple tests within the script, it all adds up and makes the process much quicker in the end. 
  I do that versus just simply "getting it to work."  
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Not dropping the ball. Unfortuately, I have done this, at least once in recent years. Within that autoamtion function I did not
  update some documentation. I was also hospitalized at the time so the team missed out on some hard won knowledge costing us a day 
  or two in the sprint.
